# For beginners
These resources are a place to get started for absolute beginners. These will teach you the basic consepts and beginner level programming. The main programming language is python. The tasks vary from beginner to intermediate levels.

## Glossary
Lean the basic [glossary](https://archive.ph/E013q) to get started.

## System requirements
Let's get real here. If you don't have the resources to run things locally, then no need to read much further. The princess is in another castle. Make sure you meet the [system requirements](https://wikia.schneedc.com/llm/system-requirements) before continuing. If you do not meet the GPTQ standards, you might still be abe to run on CPU with GPU offloading. This will be slower and require a large amount of system ram though.

## Beginner Courses
These resources are for beginners to get basic understanding of machine learning and ai. The courses are in a subjective order of difficulty.</BR></BR>
