These will teach you the basic consepts and beginner level programming. The main programming language is python. The tasks vary from beginner to intermediate levels. Glossary Lean the basic glossary to get started. System requirements Let's get real here. If you don't have the resources to run things locally, then no need to read much further. The princess is in another castle. Make sure you meet the system requirements before continuing. If you do not meet the GPTQ standards, you might still be abe to run on CPU with GPU offloading. This will be slower and require a large amount of system ram though. Beginner Courses These resources are for beginners to get basic understanding of machine learning and ai. The courses are in a subjective order of difficulty. AI for Beginners This is a general course about AI for beginners by Microsoft. This course will intorcude you to core conspets like Neural Networks, Computer Vision and Neural Language Processing. Requires some basic python experience for assignments. Generative AI for beginners This is a simple course for beginners by Microsoft. It will walk you through the very basic consepts of generative AI. These lessons require almost no coding experience. Basic Machine Learning Tutorial This is a course for machine learning for beginners by Micorosoft. You will need some basic python coding experience. This course will focus more on model training and refinment. NLP Course For Beginners HuggingFace course for Neural Language Processing. This course goes deeper into language models and explains consepts like Transformers and Finetuning. Requires moderate level of python experience. Foundational Machine Learning Google courses for machine learning. This is a somewhat more advanced course in Machine learning.","title":"For Beginners"},{"location":"beginners/#for-beginners","text":"These resources are a place to get started for absolute beginners.
